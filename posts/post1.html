            <h2>Want Solar Panels on Your Roof? Here's What You Need to Know</h2>
            <span>JULIAN SPECTOR <br> OCT 5, 2019</span>
            <p>
                The newness of mainstream consumer solar power poses a challenge. If you want to buy a car, for
                instance, there are
                plenty of people who’ve done it and can tell you how the process works. Putting solar panels on your
                roof costs as much
                as a car, but the cohort of experienced buyers is far, far smaller. The number of customers who have
                owned a solar
                system through its full lifecycle is even more limited.

                Besides that, the stakes are high—this is going on your roof, after all. “This is a big one. This is one
                where you can’t
                say, ‘well, if I make a mistake, the next time I’ll know better,’” says Jane Weissman, the president and
                CEO of the
                nonprofit Interstate Renewable Energy Council, which just released a consumer checklist and other
                resources for rooftop
                solar.
                The cost of solar keeps on falling and the number of installations keeps rising, so CityLab decided to
                chat with some
                solar experts to walk readers through the most important questions to consider before making the jump to
                solar energy. <br><br>

                <strong>1.</strong> Do you have a roof that can support solar panels? <br>
                This is pretty key. If your roof is covered in shade most of the day throughout the year, it might not
                have a favorable
                enough “solar window” to justify the costs of panels. That’s something you’ll want to assess before you
                move forward. If
                your roof won’t cut it, or you can’t make the call because you rent your apartment or live in a
                multi-unit building, you
                don’t have to give up on solar power altogether. Instead of installing your own panels, look into shared
                or community
                solar. This approach lets many different customers buy a stake in a solar installation and receive
                credits on their
                electricity bills.

                If you do have a suitably sunlit rooftop to work with, Weissman says, make sure it’s in good shape
                structurally. Solar
                installations these days can come with warranties for 20 or 25 years. If your roof will need a
                renovation a few years
                down the road, it’ll be easier to take care of that before the array goes up. That way, you won’t have
                to pay in extra
                time and money to disconnect your panels during the roof renovation and put them up again afterwards.
                While you’re at
                it, make sure you won’t run afoul of any homeowners’ association covenants that ban rooftop solar for
                aesthetic reasons.
                Lastly, envision the future of your yard. If the roof is unobstructed now but you’ve just planted a
                battalion of leafy
                oaks around your property, you might run in to trouble a few years down the road. Be prepared to prune
                your foliage to
                keep the panels clear. <br>

                <br> <br>

                <strong>2.</strong> Have you done everything you can to improve efficiency? <br>
                The amount of solar energy you need to produce depends on how much you use, so it makes sense to trim
                your usage as much
                as possible before paying for all those panels. Start with an energy audit and look for efficiency
                upgrades before you
                draw up blueprints. <br> <br>

                <strong>3.</strong> Which kind of solar makes sense? <br>
                The two dominant solar technologies to pick from are photovoltaic, which uses arrays of cells to turn
                sunlight into
                electricity, and thermal, which uses sunlight to heat water or air for use inside. If your home uses a
                lot of energy for
                heating, or you live somewhere where heating fuel is expensive relative to electricity, a solar thermal
                investment could
                break even sooner, says the engineer Timothy Wilhelm, who coordinates the electrical technology program
                and teaches
                solar installation at Kankakee Community College in Illinois. But, he adds, solar thermal is rarer for
                homes, so it
                might be harder to find a qualified installer. <br> <br>

                <strong>4.</strong> How do you connect to the grid? <br>
                The details vary depending on where you live, but the principle is that any time you’re connecting with
                a utility, there
                are a lot of logistics to sort out. Do you have to pay a fee? How long does it take for the utility to
                get you hooked
                up? Once you are connected, how and when will you be credited for the electricity you generate?

                That last one refers to net-metering, the practice by which utilities reimburse rooftop solar at the
                same rate as they
                charge users for electricity. This is politically fraught territory: some states, like Nevada, have
                adopted policies
                where utilities pay less for surplus solar, which makes it harder to recoup the cost of the
                installation. For a handy
                guide to where each state stands on this, check out this solar scorecard. <br> <br>

                <strong>5.</strong> Is your installer trustworthy?
                This applies any time you hire someone to come into your home, but solar combines the logistics of a
                home improvement
                project with the risks of electrical work. Credentials and references are especially important. “You
                wouldn’t hire an
                electrician who had never done electrical work to come into your house and change things around,” says
                Kelly Larson, an
                electrical contractor in California with 20 years of experience doing solar installations. In
                particular, look for
                accreditation from the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP). And this is a
                big expense, so
                don’t be afraid to get a few different quotes before you ink a contract.

                This is harder to predict, but, ideally, you want a company that will stick around for the lifetime of
                your
                installation. Since solar cells don’t have moving pieces, they tend to need very little maintenance,
                Larson says. Still,
                in the event that anything does stop working during the warranty period, you don’t want to realize that
                your installer
                isn’t around to fix it. <br> <br>
                <strong>6.</strong> Lease or buy? <br>
                Every household will need to run its own cost-benefit analysis on this basic trade-off. Buying your own
                system costs
                more up front but pays bigger dividends; leasing lets you access cheaper electricity with little or no
                money down, but
                the benefits are more limited. If you lease, the company you contract with owns the system, and you pay
                them a certain
                rate for the electricity; when the lease is up, they might take the system away. When you own the
                system, it can keep
                working for you long after it pays off the cost of the purchase. Make sure you compare the total
                lifecycle cost of the
                lease and weigh the savings against the benefits you would get from ownership.

                In your financial analysis, keep in mind that the panels can function for decades, Wilhelm says, but
                other electronic
                equipment in the system, like the power inverter, has a shorter lifespan. Don’t forget to factor in
                replacements for
                those other system components when budgeting the cost of the project. <br> <br>

                <strong>7.</strong> What should you see in your contract? <br>
                The contract you sign should spell out all the details of financing, ownership, and performance
                expectations. Also,
                because these systems can include web-enabled devices, you should check if anyone is collecting data on
                your home energy
                production and usage and who has access to it.

                That’s a lot of details to keep in mind. IREC collected some additional resources that dive into greater
                detail. When in
                doubt, don’t go it alone, Weissman says: “If you’re not getting the answers that you need, then it’s
                probably best to
                seek some legal advice.”
