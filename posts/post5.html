                The amount of power available to a solar panel is proportional to the amount of light that reaches it.
                The more light it
                gets, the more power it produces.

                In space, the most important source of light is the Sun. The Sun emits just about the same amount of
                light in all
                directions. <br>

                When solar panels are pointed right at the Sun(or aligned with the Sun), then they intercept the most
                light rays. <br>
                <img src="../img/sun-rays-panel.gif" alt="pic"> <br>
                When the solar panel is out of alignment, it intercepts fewer light rays. <br>
                <img src="../img/sun-rays-panel-tilted.gif" alt="pic"> <br>
                To get the most power, solar panels have to be pointed directly at the Sun. DS1 is built so that the
                solar panels can be
                pivoted as DS1 moves. Thus, they can always stay in the direct path of the light rays no matter how the
                spacecraft is
                pointed.

                Sometimes, satellite scientists purposefully orient the solar panels "off point," or out of direct
                alignment from the
                Sun. If the batteries are completely charged and the amount of electricity is needed is lower than the
                amount made if
                the panels are "on point," generating that much power isn't necessary. The extra power will just be
                vented by a shunt
                into space as heat.
