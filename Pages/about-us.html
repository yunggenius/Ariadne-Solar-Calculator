            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p><b>E</b>lectricity is all around us, even where we might not think.
                Electricity, it’s availability and accessibility in our homes and businesses, is an
                afterthought for most of us.<br>
                A Solar Panel is a device that converts light energy from the Sun to electrical energy. Solar Panels
                consist of
                Polyvoltaic Cells (a.k.a. PV cells or solar cells) that absorbs energy from Sun rays and convert it to
                DC current which can then be further processed by a power inverter to deliver power to appliances in a
                home or business.<br>
                <br>
                We developed a calculator that
                can be used to figure out the size, costs, and benefits of a grid­-tied solar PV system
                for the home or business. It can be used for both owning and leasing a system.
                Solar Calculator is your resource for everything solar. We provide all of the information you need to
                decide whether or
                not to invest in
                solar power panels and batteries. We are passionate about solar and its positive environmental and
                financial benefits.
